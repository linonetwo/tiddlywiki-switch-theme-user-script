# tiddlywiki-switch-theme-user-script

User script to auto switch theme of any public wiki that you are visiting.

[OpenUserJS](https://openuserjs.org/scripts/linonetwo/Tiddlywiki_Switch_Theme)

### Feature

You can config your preferred palette in the script (see "config" object in the script).

Note that this will overwrite the palette provided by the wiki author.

### Motivation

Seeing a white wiki at night is hurt, and seeing a dark wiki when you have all the lights on is annoying too.

So you can use this script to auto-switch the palette (not the theme, sorry) based on your environment.
